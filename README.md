**CSV Processing Automation V1**

A small, focused Rust utility for automating CSV processing workflows used in printer/user-counter analysis. This repository provides a command-line tool that reads CSV files from the `data/` folder, performs transformations and aggregations, and emits cleaned or analyzed CSV outputs for downstream use.

**Features**

- **Easy CSV ingestion:** Read input CSVs from `data/` and process them with a single command.
- **Transformations & Aggregation:** Apply filters, column mappings, and basic aggregations suitable for printer user-counter analysis.
- **Lightweight Rust CLI:** Fast and portable using Rust and Cargo.

**Getting Started**

Prerequisites:

- Rust toolchain (stable) and `cargo` installed. See <https://rustup.rs/> for installation.

Clone the repository and build:

```bash
git clone https://example.com/your-repo.git
cd CSV_Processing_Automation_V1
cargo build --release
```

Run the tool (example):

```bash
# Run with the default settings (reads from data/ and writes to stdout or configured output)
cargo run --release -- <input.csv> <output.csv>

# Example using the included sample files
cargo run --release -- data/IPA\ Busia\ Printer_usercounter_20251203.csv data/output_cleaned.csv
```

Adjust the command to match the binary's CLI flags if provided by the project (check `--help`):

```bash
cargo run --release -- --help
```

**Data**

- Input CSVs are stored in the `data/` folder. Example files included:
 	- `Busia_Printer_Analyzed_Output.csv`
 	- `IPA Busia Printer_usercounter_20251203.csv`

Notes on expected format:

- The tool expects well-formed CSVs with a header row. Column names and required fields depend on the processing logic inside `src/`.

**Project Structure**

- `Cargo.toml` — Rust manifest and dependencies.
- `src/` — Rust source files (`main.rs`, `lib.rs`).
- `data/` — Example CSV inputs used for testing and demonstration.
- `target/` — Build artifacts (generated by Cargo).

**Development**

- Build in debug mode during development:

```bash
cargo build
```

- Run the CLI locally with input file paths. Use `--` to pass args to the binary when running via `cargo run`.

If you add automatic tests, run them with:

```bash
cargo test
```

If you'd like, I can:

- add a sample usage section that shows before/after CSV snippets,
- detect the CLI signature from `src/main.rs` and auto-generate accurate usage examples, or
- add a `LICENSE` file (MIT/Apache) and commit it.
